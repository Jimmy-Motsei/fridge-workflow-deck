# Client-Borne Cost Estimate (WhatsApp Fridge Workflow)

**Date:** 2025-09-16  
**Currency:** ZAR (South African Rand)  
**Context:** Costs the client will pay directly (or as pass-through). Provider build fees and post-trial subscription are excluded. WhatsApp template pricing varies by country/category—scenarios below use **assumed per-template averages** to give you a planning range.

## One-Time Costs

| Item | Assumption | Estimate (ZAR) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Domain registration | `.co.za` or similar | **120–300** (renewal annually) |
| QR sticker printing | 500 UV-laminated vinyl stickers @ R5–12 each | **2,500–6,000** |
| Field deployment (stickers) | 1–3 field days incl. transport | **1,500–5,000** |
| Business verification & access | Admin setup, docs | **0** |
| Brand assets & English copy | You supply | **0** |
| Village list & (optional) pole IDs | You supply CSV | **0** |
| Test device (optional) | Assuming you have one | **0** |

**One-time subtotal:** **ZAR 4,120 – 11,300**  
*(Assumes 500 stickers. Add ~R500–R1,200 per extra 100 stickers.)*

## Recurring Monthly Costs (During Trial & Beyond)

| Item | Assumption | Monthly (ZAR) |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Dedicated WhatsApp SIM | 1 line | **50–200** |
| Shared mailbox (alerts/KPI emails) | e.g., Microsoft/Google workspace | **0–99** |
| WhatsApp template message fees (Meta) | See **usage scenarios** below | **variable** |

## WhatsApp Template Usage Scenarios (planning ranges)

Assumed **average delivered template cost**: **R1.20–R2.00** (illustrative). Actuals depend on recipient country mix & template category.

| Scenario | Templates / month | Template fees (ZAR) | Monthly total incl. SIM & mailbox (ZAR) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **A — Light** | 300 | **360–600** | **410–899** |
| **B — Moderate** | 800 | **960–1,600** | **1,010–1,899** |
| **C — Active** | 1,500 | **1,800–3,000** | **1,850–3,299** |

**Base monthly (excl. templates):** **R50–R299** (SIM + mailbox). Domain renewal: ~R120 per year (not monthly).

## 2-Month Trial Cost Projection (Client Only)

Adds two months of recurring to the one-time setup. Useful for budgeting the pilot.

| Scenario | One-time (ZAR) | 2× Monthly (ZAR) | **Total for Trial (ZAR)** |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **A — Light** | 4,120–11,300 | 820–1,798 | **4,940–13,098** |
| **B — Moderate** | 4,120–11,300 | 2,020–3,798 | **6,140–15,098** |
| **C — Active** | 4,120–11,300 | 3,700–6,598 | **7,820–17,898** |

## Optional Client Extras (if you choose to procure)

| Item | Assumption | Estimate (ZAR) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Setswana translation vendor | ~800 words @ R1.8–2.5/word | **1,500–2,000** (one-time) |
| Additional SIM lines | per extra number | **50–200 / mo** |
| Additional mailboxes | per mailbox | **0–99 / mo** |
| Spare test phone | entry-level Android | **1,500–3,500** (one-time) |

## Assumptions & Notes

* v1 ships **English**; **Setswana** added post-pilot (translation cost only if you ask us to procure it).
* Client pays **Meta's WhatsApp template message fees** directly (or via card on file in Business Manager). Service messages inside the customer service window are generally free; outbound templates are billable.
* Quantities (stickers, templates/month) can be adjusted—totals scale linearly.
* Post-trial **subscription pricing is TBD** and will be proposed after the build and 2-month trial once real usage and scaling prospects are known.
